This is my first public repository on github.

These are the first 4 projects that I made in Python3 . They do not use GUI libraries.
I had completed 32% of the bootcamp in python3 on udemy when i uploaded these on 7/2/21. 

You need to have python3 installed to play these games and use the dictionary.
